# Cat Collectr
This is a my first django app of cat collectr

## How does it work
The app lists cats adapoted by users. Cat model stores cat name, breed, description, and age. The app also lists cats toys owned by cats. Cat toy model stores toy name and color. Users have profile which lists the cats they owned. On each cat detail page, it displays this cat info and the toys it owns. There are update and delete buttons for each cat and toy.
